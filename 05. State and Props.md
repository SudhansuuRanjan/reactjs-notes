# 05\. State and Props

### State:
- State in functional components is managed using the `useState` Hook, which is a built-in React Hook.
- The `useState` Hook allows you to declare and update state variables within a functional component.
- State variables can hold data that may change over time, and updates to state trigger re-rendering of the component.
- Each call to `useState` returns an array with the current state value and a function to update that value.
- By calling the update function (`setState` equivalent), you can modify the state value.

Example of state usage in a functional component:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Props:
- Props in functional components are received as function parameters.
- Props allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
- Functional components can access the props directly within the component body.

Example of props usage in a functional component:

```js
import React from 'react';

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>{props.message}</p>;
}

function ParentComponent() {
  const message = "Hello, World!";
  return <ChildComponent message={message} />;
}
```

Functional components with Hooks provide a simpler and more concise way of managing state and props, promoting code readability and reusability. With the adoption of React Hooks, class components are no longer necessary for most use cases, and functional components offer a more modern and streamlined approach to building React applications.
