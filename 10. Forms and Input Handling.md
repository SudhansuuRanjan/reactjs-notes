# 10\. Forms and Input Handling

Handling forms and user input in React involves capturing and managing user input data. React provides tools and techniques to handle form submissions, input validation, and updating state based on user input. Here's an example of how to handle forms and input in a React functional component:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyForm() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '',
    email: '',
  });

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    const { name, value } = event.target;
    setFormData((prevData) => ({
      ...prevData,
      [name]: value,
    }));
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Do something with the form data
    console.log(formData);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="name"
          name="name"
          value={formData.name}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
        <input
          type="email"
          id="email"
          name="email"
          value={formData.email}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

In the example above:

- The `formData` state variable is initialized using the `useState` hook. It represents the form data, with initial values for `name` and `email`.
- The `handleChange` function captures user input by extracting the `name` and `value` from the input fields and updating the `formData` state using the spread syntax (`...`) and computed property names (`[name]`).
- The `handleSubmit` function is triggered when the form is submitted. It prevents the default form submission behavior and performs any desired actions with the form data, in this case, logging it to the console.
- Each input field has a corresponding `value` prop that is bound to the respective field in the `formData` state, and the `onChange` event handler is assigned to capture and update user input.

By using these techniques, you can capture and update form data in real-time, perform validation, and respond to form submissions in React functional components.
