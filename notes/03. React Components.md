# 03\. React Components

React Components is a fundamental concept in ReactJS that allows you to build reusable and self-contained pieces of user interface. Components are the building blocks of a React application and can be classified into two types: functional components and class components.

### Functional Components:

Functional components are stateless and pure JavaScript functions.
They receive props (properties) as parameters and return JSX (HTML-like) elements that define the component's UI.

Example:
```js
function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
}
```
### Class Components:

Class components are JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component base class.
They have their own state and can handle lifecycle methods.
Class components render JSX in the render() method.

Example:
```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello, {this.props.name}!</div>;
  }
}
```
Key points about React Components:

- Components can be composed and nested, allowing for modular and reusable code.
- Props allow data to be passed from parent components to child components.
- Components can have their own state that can be updated using the setState() method in class components.
- The render() method defines the JSX structure of a component.
- Components can be functional or class-based, depending on the complexity and need for state and lifecycle methods.
- Re-rendering of components is triggered by changes in props or state.
