# 09\. List and Keys

When rendering lists of data in React, it's important to assign a unique key prop to each item. Keys help React efficiently identify and update elements within the list. Here's an example of how to render a list of items with keys in a React functional component:

```js
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

In the example above:

- The `items` prop is an array of objects, each having a unique `id` property.
- Inside the `map()` function, each item is rendered as an `<li>` element.
- The `key` prop is set to the `item.id`, providing a unique identifier for each rendered item.

Key points to note about lists and keys in React:

- Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed in a list. This enables efficient updates without re-rendering the entire list.
- Keys must be unique among siblings in the list but don't necessarily have to be globally unique.
- It's recommended to use a stable identifier for keys, such as a unique ID from the data or a combination of properties that form a unique identifier.
- Avoid using array indices as keys, especially if the order of items may change or if you have dynamic lists with items being added, removed, or re-ordered.
- Keys should not be mistaken for "props" or accessed within the component. They are solely used by React for optimizing updates.
- React uses keys internally to reconcile the state of the rendered list with the previous state, providing a smooth updating experience.

By providing keys to the items in a list, React can efficiently manage and update the list when changes occur, resulting in better performance and a smoother user experience.
