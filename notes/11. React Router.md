# 11\. React Router

React Router is a popular library that enables routing functionality in React applications. It allows you to create multiple pages, handle navigation, and manage the application's URL structure. Here's an example of how to use React Router in a functional component:

First, you need to install React Router using a package manager like npm or Yarn:

```shell
npm install react-router-dom
```

Next, you can define your routes and render components based on the current URL:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Home() {
  return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
}

function About() {
  return <h2>About Page</h2>;
}

function Contact() {
  return <h2>Contact Page</h2>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/about">About</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        <Routes>
          <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
          <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
          <Route path="/" element={<Home/>} />
        </Routes>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the above example:

- The `Router` component from React Router wraps the entire application, enabling routing functionality.
- The `Link` component is used to create navigation links that trigger route changes when clicked.
- The `Routes` component renders only the first `Route` that matches the current URL, preventing multiple routes from rendering simultaneously.
- Each `Route` component defines a path and the component to render when that path matches the current URL.

```js
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  RouterProvider,
} from "react-router-dom";
import "./index.css";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <div>Hello world!</div>,
  },
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

By using React Router, you can create a multi-page application with different routes, enabling users to navigate between pages while keeping the URL in sync with the current view. React Router provides additional features like nested routes, route parameters, redirects, and more, allowing for flexible and powerful routing capabilities in your React application.
