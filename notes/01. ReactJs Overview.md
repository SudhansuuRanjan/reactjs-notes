# 01\. ReactJs Overview

### Introduction

ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components. According to React official documentation, following is the definition âˆ’

React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow, which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.

## Why do we need Frontend Libraries?

1. Frontend libraries follow a declarative approach, where developers specify what the UI should look like based on the application state, rather than imperatively defining how to update the UI.
2. This declarative nature of frontend libraries abstracts away the manual manipulation of the DOM, making it easier to manage complex application states and UI interactions.
3. By describing the desired UI state, developers can focus more on the "what" rather than the "how," leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
4. Declarative programming in frontend libraries reduces the risk of bugs caused by mutable state and side effects.
5. It allows for easier debugging and understanding of the codebase, as the UI rendering is based on the underlying data flow.
6. The declarative approach encourages separation of concerns, as UI components can be isolated and managed independently.
7. Frontend libraries provide tools and mechanisms to efficiently handle updates to the UI based on changes in the application state, without explicitly defining the steps for UI manipulation.
8. Declarative programming in frontend libraries promotes code reusability and modularity, as components can be composed and reused across different parts of the application.
9. Developers can take advantage of the library's internal optimizations and algorithms, as the library handles the rendering and updating of the UI efficiently.
10. The declarative approach in frontend libraries simplifies the development of complex applications by abstracting away low-level implementation details and providing higher-level abstractions for building user interfaces.
