# ReactJs Interview Questions

After covering the topics of introduction, why we need frontend libraries, and advantages of ReactJS, here are some additional topics you can consider covering in a serial manner for your note on ReactJS:

1. React Components: Understanding the concept of components in React, including functional components and class components.

2. JSX: Explaining JSX syntax and its role in combining JavaScript and HTML-like code in React.

3. State and Props: Understanding the concepts of state and props in React, how they are used to manage data and pass data between components.

4. Lifecycle Methods: Exploring the lifecycle methods available in React components and their significance in different phases of a component's existence.

5. Handling Events: Covering event handling in React components and how to respond to user interactions.

6. Conditional Rendering: Explaining conditional rendering techniques in React to dynamically show or hide elements based on certain conditions.

7. Lists and Keys: Understanding how to render lists of data in React components and the importance of using keys for efficient rendering and updates.

8. Forms and Input Handling: Covering form handling in React, including controlled components and handling user input.

9. React Router: Introducing React Router, a popular library for handling routing in React applications, enabling multi-page functionality.

10. State Management: Exploring state management options in React, such as using React's built-in state management or integrating external libraries like Redux or MobX.

11. Hooks: Introducing React Hooks, a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows functional components to have state and lifecycle features previously available only in class components.

12. Context API: Explaining the Context API in React, which provides a way to share data between components without passing props explicitly.

13. React and API Integration: Discussing techniques for integrating React applications with APIs and making HTTP requests.

14. React Testing: Covering different approaches to testing React components, including unit testing and integration testing.

15. Best Practices and Performance Optimization: Highlighting best practices for organizing React code, optimizing performance, and improving the overall development experience.

16. Deployment: Discussing different options and strategies for deploying React applications, including hosting platforms and build optimizations.

Remember, the order in which you cover these topics may depend on your target audience and their level of familiarity with React.
