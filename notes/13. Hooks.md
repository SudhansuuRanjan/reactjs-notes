# 13\. Hooks

Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They provide a way to manage component state, handle side effects, and access lifecycle functionalities without using class components. Here are some commonly used React hooks:

1. useState: useState is used to manage state within functional components. It returns a state value and a function to update that value.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. useEffect: useEffect allows you to perform side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions, DOM manipulation) in functional components. It takes a function as its first argument, which will be executed after rendering.

```js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Perform side effects here
    console.log('Component mounted');

    return () => {
      // Cleanup code here (optional)
      console.log('Component unmounted');
    };
  }, []);

  return <div>My Component</div>;
}
```

3. useContext: useContext allows you to access the value of a React context within a functional component.

```js
import React, { useContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return <div>Current theme: {theme}</div>;
}
```

4. useReducer: useReducer is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic. It is similar to the reducer function used in Redux.

```js
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid action');
  }
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  const increment = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

5. useId: The `useId` hook generates a unique identifier that remains consistent across re-renders. It can be helpful when generating unique IDs for elements or associating labels with form inputs.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useId } from 'react-id-generator';

function MyComponent() {
  const [inputId] = useId();

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={inputId}>Input Label:</label>
      <input id={inputId} type="text" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useId` generates a unique ID and assigns it to both the `htmlFor` attribute of the label and the `id` attribute of the input element, ensuring a proper association.

6. useLayoutEffect: `useLayoutEffect` is similar to `useEffect` but runs synchronously after the DOM is updated. It's useful when you need to perform DOM measurements or other imperative operations that require immediate feedback.

```js
import React, { useLayoutEffect, useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const ref = useRef();

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // Perform DOM-related operations
    const { current } = ref;
    console.log(current.getBoundingClientRect());
  }, []);

  return <div ref={ref}>Component Content</div>;
}
```

In this example, `useLayoutEffect` is used to measure the bounding rectangle of the `div` element referenced by `ref`. Since `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously, it ensures accurate measurements before rendering.

7. useMemo: The `useMemo` hook allows you to memoize the result of a function call, preventing unnecessary recomputations. It is helpful when you have expensive computations or calculations that depend on specific values.

```js
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ a, b }) {
  const result = useMemo(() => {
    // Expensive computation based on 'a' and 'b'
    return a + b;
  }, [a, b]);

  return <div>Result: {result}</div>;
}
```

In this example, the result of the computation is memoized using `useMemo`. The computation will only re-run if either `a` or `b` changes, saving unnecessary calculations when other dependencies remain the same.

These additional React hooks provide additional capabilities and optimization opportunities within functional components. `useId` helps with generating unique identifiers, `useLayoutEffect` ensures DOM-related operations run synchronously, and `useMemo` helps memoize the result of expensive computations.

These are just a few examples of React hooks. Hooks allow you to write reusable and modular code, enable functional components to have state and lifecycle functionalities, and provide a more concise and expressive way of working with React features. Hooks have greatly simplified React development and are widely adopted by the React community.
